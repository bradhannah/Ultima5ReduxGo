            This simple spell creates a pool of light. Although a short duration, In Lor creates a brighter light than the best of torches. Note, however, that In Lor cannot be used in place of real flame to enhance the mixing of reagents for spells, for its properties are quite different.
            In Lor's sole ingredient is sulphurous ash powder. Place the powder upon the object intended as the light source; rub it rhythmically while chanting "In Lor." Almost instantly, the object will blaze with white light.

        itemdescription: A novice magic user had best count on a good solid weapon in battle. A good spell for novices to practice, not rely in battle, is Grav Por, which casts a missile of energy at a target on the battlefield. If the caster's mental powers exceed the foe's, small damage will be inflicted. Grav Por requires sulphurous ash for energy and black pearl to project it. This spell has little effect for novices, not because of weak ingredients, but because of inexperience.

So common is the use of poison that alchemists have been able to devise a formula, using the relatively common plants garlic and ginseng, that is effective against nearly every form of poison in nearly every user. However, the magic works on individuals only; thus, simple as it is, novice mages in a party mush have magic endurance among them great enough to cast An Nox as many times as they have afflicted members. Even then, safety is not secured. Strength already sapped by toxins is not regained without peaceful rest or healing magic.

        itemdescription: Many evil creatures carry chests full of treasure and useful items, often the result of thievery against some other good Britannian. No good person begrudges the vanquisher a monster's gold and good, but evil creatures often arm their chests with deadly traps. Popular chest traps are acid sprays, poison fumes, bombs and gaseous atmospheres. The first two are designed with intent to destroy the individual tampering with the lock. The last two a affect the entire area of the chest and injure anyone in that area. An Sanct used blood moss and sulphurous ash to seep into hidden traps and render them impotent. The spell also negates any non-magical locks in the chest. The same spell may be used to unlock doors locked by mechanical keys.

They act mindlessly, unaware of their own horrible state. By negating their armour of mindlessness, An Xen Corp causes most risen dead to flee in lurching terror. An Xen Corp is not a difficult spell, especially for casters of good intellect. Nor is its mixture difficult: ordinary amounts of common garlic and sulphurous ash must be mixed while pronouncing words of reverence for life and beauty.'

These novice mages may quickly and frequently turn to Kal Xen to add to the offensive ranks of their party in battle. Kal Xen summons small nasty creatures such as rats and snakes to help in combat. Nasty or not, these summoned beasts are always loyal to the caster, and often direct a foe's attention away from members of the mage's party. Mix mandrake root with spider silk to ensure the beast's loyalty. The local where the mandrake root is gathered influences what type of creature is summoned.

A simple spell, the great advantage of Vas Flam is that, aimed accurately, it will surely hit its mark and, just as surely, inflict damage. Combine common sulphurous ash and a single black pearl over a hot flame. When the ash has adhered well to the pearl, remove it and store it until needed. Cast the talisman at a foe while uttering "Vas Flam."

Be careful not to direct this spell too close to friends or they shall suffer the same as foes. Sulphurous ash and black pearl project the burning fire to the chosen spot; spider silk holds it there a short while. The mix works best when blended over a flame.

The spell cloaks a foe in purple haze that puts it instantly to sleep, taking it out of the fight, rendering it helpless. Like the other two similar spells, In Zu Grav can affect friends as easily as enemies. While sleep will not directly harm friends, falling asleep on the field of battle can be deadly. In Zu Grav is easily mixed of common ginseng, spider silk and black pearl. For best results, add the air of many yawns and sand from sleepy eyes.

        itemdescription: In Por teleports an entire party a fair distance in any specified direction. However, incanting this spell during the haste of battle will diminish its effects. It will only remove the caster, and then only to another place on the battlefield. In Por will not transport a party if there is no clear, grassy spot to which the party can be moved. Nor will In Por work in dungeons or in townes, as its energies require a fair bit of open space to operate. The dust for In Por consists of spider silk and fresh young blood moss. The caster must close his eyes and conjure a vision of the current position after the party has left. In a wink, the party will be elsewhere and the vision, reality.

The powder for In bet Xen consists of sulphurous ash to give life energy, blood moss to set them swarming, and spider silk to bind the swarm in obedience. For deadliest results, blend with stagnant water from the dankest swamp.

While mixing, sing a melody that no other creature has every heard. For greatest security, the melody should be different each mixing; so each magical lock will require a subtly different magical key, and anyone trying to break the magical lock will not be able to use any previously discovered keys.

While it provides neither antidote to poison nor cure for disease, Vas Mani does heal all damage wrought by these ravagers, ensuring survival until a cure can be found. The difficulty in preparing Vas Mani is in locating the mandrake root; otherwise the preparation is straightforward; mix the mandrake root with ginseng and spider silk. To cast Vas Mani successfully, the caster must concentrate totally on the subject to be healed. When the concentration is full, one can actually see wounds heal. Because the healing process can take several hours, Vas Mani cannot be used during combat.

        itemdescription: |-
            A most effective tactic to use against enemies is to charm members of their party to work against them. However, this spell is most difficult to apply where it could be of the most help, against the most diabolical of foes, those of superior intelligence. Control of a charmed individual is limited to fighting and moving; it does not extend to use of magic or special forms of attack. This spell can also be used to bring back party members after they have been charmed by a foe.
            An Xen Ex requires a careful mixture of nightshade, to poison the mind; a black pearl, for projection; and spider silk to bind loyalty

Mix mandrake root and nightshade picked in absolute darkness with blood moss to bend the light. It is essential that, while intoning this spell, none see any indication of its casting. Speak without moving lips.

Mix nightshade that has never seen light with black pearl. Pour the powder into a small lead capsule and seal with black wax. While intoning the spell, hurl the capsule at the foe selected for destruction.

        itemspriteexposed: 260
        itemdescription: Another powerful combat spell is In Quas Xen. By means of illusion, this spell duplicates friend or foe, in every detail. Although the new creature is an illusion, it fights and bleeds exactly as the original. When a friend is cloned, the original and duplicates are still joined. Injury to each is felt by the other, death to one destroys the other. Yet the two are physically separate; they have independent turns in battle and may work together to vanquish a foe. When a hostile creature is duplicated, no connection between copy and original seems to remain. Pain to a monster's clone is not felt by the monster; and death of the creature does not remove the clone. The power of mandrake root is essential to this spell; as are the illusionary properties of nightshade. To mature the root, add spider silk to bind and ginseng to heal; mix with the living energy of sulphurous ash and add blood moss for animation. When casting the spell, fling the glittering sand that results into the air. The wind will catch the granules, and where the first one touches earth, there shall the clone arise.

It is illusion and reality. The change of viewpoint is illusion, but the knowledge provided is real. Powerful mages can replicate these miraculous effects through magic. In Quas Wis requires only two ingredients to create its illusion. Only the most powerful mandrake root will work for this spell; and only the most convoluted stems of nightshade. Mix the two in the dark of night with seven drops of cold spring water. Let the moisture evaporate, then place the shimmering powder in a cloth sack. When intoning In Quas Wis, cast the powder high to view the world about as if from the air. If cast within a towne, building or dungeon, all the detail of that level is revealed.

Fear strikes foes to the cores of their beings. They shriek and flee. In Quas Corp is expensive. The dust that must fill the atmosphere as the spell is cast contains both mandrake root and hallucinatory nightshade. Simple garlic adds to the distastefulness of the experience for the foe.

Resurrection requires such total concentration and peace of mind that it should never be attempted on the harried field of battle. To mix, place a mandrake root in a sieve in a fresh water spring on a sunlit day. One by one, add garlic, to keep away ills and evil, spider silk, for binding the life forces together, ginseng for healing, sulphurous ash for the spark of life, and blood moss to animate the spirit. Remove the sieve from the spring and let the mixture dry. A small crystal will form from the drying mass. To revive a companion, place the crystal on the friend's forehead and intone In Mani Corp. The resurrected person will be weak and in need of further assistance.

But only an experienced wizard is able to devote the concentration needed to bind the daemon's allegiance and prevent it from turning on his party. Then, although the daemon cannot use its own powers of possession, it can hurl great balls of fire across long distance to smite foes. Mandrake root, gathered as near as possible to an entrance to dungeons, pits, and other vile holes, is the base of this spell. Add garlic, blood moss and the strongest spider silk. Mix the lot together letting the moisture of the root act as a binding. Now shape the mixture into the form of the winged daemon. Raise the icon to the sky, into this spell and hear it calling its own.

Mandrake root must be gathered on a dark night during a lightning storm. It must be marinated in slime from stagnant mosquito fens and wrapped in nightshade, which must have been picked at midnight in total darkness. This package should be rolled in sulphurous ash and left on a grave overnight. If it is not discovered, it is ready to be dried into stringy dreadlocks of death.

Sulphurous ash, blood moss and mandrake root combine best for this spell in an iron cauldron over great heat.

To travel, cast the powder in the direction of the gate to be reached while speaking the name of that gate's town followed by Vas Rel Por. Immediately drop to the ground and meditate on the proper phases of the moon for that gate. Instantly, the party will be there.

It is a tribute to the brilliance and creativity of Britannian minds that experts, undaunted by their failures, simply turned the problem around and found a way to achieve every advantage of briefly controlling time without actually controlling it at all. Those capable of this spell will witness their foes paralyzed in mid-motion. After a few moments, all returns to normal, just as though time had actually stopped and started up again. However, the caster's party remains active throughout the spell. An Tym requires a mixture of mandrake root, well-preserved blood moss and a garlic clove.

            At the same time as Lord British was gaining a reputation for fair and honest government over his provinces and attracting attention for his startlingly innovative ideas, Mondain was using his father's gem against itself to produce a black jewel that would render him and his evil immortal. Success meant gaining even greater power over the minions of darkness.

        itemdescription: The magical amulet consists of a silver, serpentine medallion suspended from a gold chain, its likeness variously attributed to Britannia's rarely-observed silver serpents, and even the Great Earth Serpent itself. It emanates a blue aura and is notably warm to the touch, imbued with enchantments that have allowed it both to facilitate interplanetary moongate travel and pierce supernatural forms of darkness.

Their power, awesome though it may seem, is limited, allowing the traveler to teleport only from the location of one moonstone to that of another. The moonstone the user travels to is determined by the phase of the moon that appears directly overhead in the sky. Through experimentation and observation, the moongate traveler can correlate the phases of the highest moon with the destination the gate will select.
