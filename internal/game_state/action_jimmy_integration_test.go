// Integration tests for ActionJimmy functionality using real game data
// These tests would test complete jimmy flows with actual map data

// TODO: Add integration tests for ActionJimmy when real game data testing is implemented
// Future integration tests might test:
// - Jimmy on actual door tiles in Britain
// - Door state changes after successful jimmy
// - Key consumption with real game state
// - Character selection with full party setup
