// Unit tests for GameState functionality
// These tests should focus on isolated logic without external dependencies

// TODO: Add unit tests for GameState methods when internal logic is refactored
// Currently most GameState functionality is tightly coupled to game references and save data
// Future unit tests might test:
// - State validation logic
// - Simple getter/setter methods
// - Pure computation methods without external dependencies
