// Unit tests for ActionOpen functionality
// These tests should focus on isolated logic without external dependencies

// TODO: Add unit tests for ActionOpen methods when internal logic is refactored
// Currently ActionOpen methods are tightly coupled to game state and map data
// Future unit tests might test:
// - Door detection logic
// - Direction validation
// - State validation before opening
