**Ultima V: Warriors of Destiny** is widely considered one of the greatest RPGs ever made.

- **Living world** where NPCs follow daily schedules  
- **Rich dialogue system** with hundreds of characters to meet
- **Tactical combat** against monsters and guards
- **Magic system** with dozens of spells to master
- **Exploration** across towns, dungeons, and the vast overworld

## The Story So Far

Years have passed since you proved yourself as the Avatar and established the eight virtues throughout Britannia. But something has gone terribly wrong. Lord British has vanished, and the kingdom now lies under the harsh rule of Blackthorn, who has twisted the virtues into a rigid code of laws.

Your old companions have been scattered:
- **Iolo** hides in the deep woods
- **Shamino** has fled to a distant island  
- **Dupre** leads a resistance from the sewers
- Others have gone into exile or worse

The people suffer under oppressive laws where small transgressions lead to imprisonment or death. Ancient shrines lie abandoned, and a mysterious organization called the "Oppression" enforces Blackthorn's will with an iron fist.

As the Avatar, you must reunite your companions, rediscover the true meaning of virtue, and find a way to restore balance to Britannia - all while avoiding the watchful eyes of Blackthorn's guards.
